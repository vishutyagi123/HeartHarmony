# Heart Disease Prediction and Risk Assessment Web Application

## Overview
- This project aims to develop a predictive model for early detection and risk assessment of heart diseases. Leveraging machine learning techniques and predictive analytics, the tool utilizes a subset of a comprehensive dataset, focusing on key variables such as 'HadHeartAttack' among others. The ultimate goal is to create an effective and accessible web application that aids in healthcare improvement by providing users with personalized risk assessments and early detection capabilities.

### Features
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction
- Intuitive web interface for user interaction
- Provides risk assessment based on key variables
- Scalable architecture to accommodate future enhancements and features
### Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Bootstrap
### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-prediction.git
2. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
